# hello-world
Sample
I am a Computer Science major. I would like to be a Software Developer. 
I'm a returning student and so far I have been relearning HTML & CSS, and learning about Algorithm Design & Implementation this semster at Sacramento City College. In my Algorithm Design & Implementation class I've been learning about C++. C++ is fascinating and a powerful language. 
Ideally, I would like to transfer to UC San Diego ideally. The last time I was in college, I did not do so well as life happens and I did not feel motivated to go to school anymore. My grades faltered and my GPA deeply reflected that. Now, I'm pursuing a career of my choosing and not have others choose what's best for me.
